            <h3>EduCommit was founded by two first generation Indian-American citizens who have come to realize how privileged they are to have been raised in a country where high quality education is accessible and affordable. <br><br>Anirudh and Neeraj, the founders of EduCommit, met at Summer Ventures, a four-week long camp where high school students immerse themselves in science, technology, engineering, and math classes taught by professors who are paving the way for change in their respective fields. During the program, students are assigned to complete a research project of their choice, and the two friends partnered to design a project that could make a real difference</h3>

          <h3>Tutoring helps students improve their academic performance or learn a new subject by providing a one-on-one learning experience tailored to each mentee. Unfortunately, however, many children do not have the means to afford a tutor, and even fewer have the privilege of attending a proper school.<br><br>Through EduCommit, all students will be able to search for tutors near them for free. Mentors will pay a fifteen dollar monthly subscription in order to be listed as a tutor on the site. Twelve dollars of every subscription will go towards funding international children's eduction initiatives, and the remaining three dollars will support EduCommit website maintenance.</h3>

          <h3>Proceeds from mentor subscriptions to EduCommit will be donated to Pratham, an organization that benefits rural India and was selected because of the backgrounds of the project's founders and mentor, Dr. Ramesh D. Mathur. In alignment with the growth of similar successful Internet-based nonprofits (Kickstarter, GoFundMe, and Angie's List), EduCommit expects to have at least 1,000 mentors listed within the first four months. With 1,000 tutors, EduCommit will be able to donate <strong>$12,000 per month</strong> directly to Pratham. <br> According to Pratham, it only takes <strong>$25</strong> to fund an Indian child's education for a <strong>full year</strong>, allowing EduCommit to provide <strong>480 kids an education <i><u>every month</u></i>.</strong> Assuming we reach 500,000,000 tutors (a lofty, yet attainable goal), EduCommit will be able to support <strong>2,400,000 kids each month</strong> in getting an education. If we succeed, <strong>within a year, every child in India will have received access to a proper education</strong> (250,000,000 kids do not have access to a proper education)</h3>
