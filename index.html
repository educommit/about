            <h3>EduCommit was founded by two first generation Indian-American citizens when they realized how privileged they had been to be born and raised into a great country with a great family, and most importantly, a great education. <br><br>Anirudh and Neeraj, the collaborators on this project, met at a four week camp in which students immerse themselves in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math classes with professors who are paving the way for change. At the end, students have to come up with a research project and presentation. They decided to make a project that they believe could really make a difference</h3>

          <h3>Tutoring often helps a student earn the grades he/she wants, and/or helps a student learn what he/she wants. Unfortunately, however, many kids do not have the privilege of being able to hire a tutor, and even less have the privilege of being able to even go to a proper school.<br><br>Through EduCommit, students who can afford, and even those who cannot, will be able to find the tutors near them whom they need in order to master a subject. It will be completely free for students to look up and find a tutor near them that suits all their needs, but the mentors have to pay a $15 monthly subscription fee in order to be listed as a mentor on the site, of which $12 goes towards funding children, and $3 goes towards site maintenance.</h3>

          <h3>EduCommit will start off in rural India and the United States primarily because of the ethnicities of the founders and mentor, Dr. Ramesh D. Mathur. Hopefully mocking the growth of other successful such nonprofits that are based off the internet (Kickstarter, GoFundMe, and Angie's List), within the span of about four months, we will have reached at least about 1,000 tutors listed on our site. With 1,000 tutors, that is <strong>$12,000 per month</strong> being directly sent to Pratham, the nonprofit organization in India that helps children in India get an education. According to Pratham, it only takes <strong>$25</strong> to educate a child in India for a <strong>full year</strong> of education, thus giving <strong>480 new kids an education <i><u>every month</u></i>.</strong> Assuming we reach 500,000,000 tutors (a lofty yet somewhat attainable goal), that is <strong>2,400,000 kids per month</strong> getting an education, and thus <strong>within a year every child in India will have gotten a proper education</strong> (250,000,000 kids do not have access to a proper education)</h3>
